## Just Vim Setup

If you just want the vim pimp:
- install Vundle with
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```
- then copy my .vimrc file to ~/.vimrc on your computer
- open vim and install the Vundle packages with `:VundleInstall`
- then exit and go back into vim and everything should be peachy keen
